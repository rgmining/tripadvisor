Trip Advisor Dataset Loader
===========================

|GPLv3| |Build Status| |Release| |PyPi| |Japanese|

|Logo|

For the `Review Graph Mining project <https://github.com/rgmining>`__,
this package provides a loader of the `Trip Advisor
dataset <https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/dataset.html>`__ provided by `Dr.
Wang <http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/>`__.

Installation
------------

Use pip to install this package.

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install --upgrade rgmining-tripadvisor-dataset

Usage
-----

This package provides module ``tripadvisor`` and this module provides
``load`` function. The ``load`` function takes a graph object.

For example, the following code constructs a graph object provides the
`FRAUDAR <http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/subtopic/view/fraudar-bounding-graph-fraud-in-the-face-of-camouflage>`__
algorithm, loads the Trip Advisor dataset, runs the algorithm, and then
outputs names of anomalous reviewers. Since this dataset consists of
huge reviews, loading may take long time.

.. code:: py

    import fraudar
    import tripadvisor

    # Construct a graph and load the dataset.
    graph = fraudar.ReviewGraph()
    tripadvisor.load(graph)

    # Run the analyzing algorithm.
    graph.update()

    # Print names of reviewers who are judged as anomalous.
    for r in graph.reviewers:
      if r.anomalous_score == 1:
        print r.name

    # The number of reviewers the dataset has: -> 1169456.
    len(graph.reviewers)

    # The number of reviewers judged as anomalous: -> 147.
    len([r for r in graph.reviewers if r.anomalous_score == 1])

Note that you may need to install the FRAUDAR algorithm for the Review
Mining Project by ``pip install rgmining-fraudar``.
